# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Worked on Twitter Hate Speech Data to predict whether a twwet contains Racist or Sexist remarks.<br>
<b>Machine Learning Methods Used</b>
Used n-grams as features; Used TFIDF & Bag of words model to convert Tweet to vector of features.<br>
Used SMOTE to reduce the data imbalance by creating synthetic Hate tweets.<br>
Applied Random Forest, Naive Bayes and ANN for prediction.<br><br>

<b>Deep Learning Methods</b><br>
Used an Embedding layer followed by an LSTM Architecture. Also used Bi-directional LSTM.<br><br>
<b>RESULT</b>
Got Best accuracy of 95% and F1 score 70.7% using Bi-Directional LSTM.
